# UnusualDinerWebpage

This is a website I created in about a week. A basic webpage for a diner, which has JS Cart and Email check. 

Comparing to the Violin Store webpage's cart, this one is more  complex - you can pick only one item from the section (chicken, rice, beans, etc...). Also, there are required and optional items. So basically, you can't set a catering order if you don't have all of the required items in the cart.

As for email check, its pretty simple: if the innerText is not a number, at least 10 symbols long, and includes text '@gmail.com', then you're good to go, but if at least one of the parameters listed before is false, you get an alert saying "'Please use your email address".
